# Interactive-Information-Poster
The basis of this assignment is to take complex information – statistics, research
results, data comparison, forms, charts, analysis, etc., – and present it in the most
efficient and easily understood way possible. The specific difference between this
form of design and traditional infographics is the dynamic nature of the interactive
information design. In this context the complexity of information can parse both live
and static content from a variety of sources with realtime results. This data could be
drawn from data bases, user inputs, algorithms, etc.,
